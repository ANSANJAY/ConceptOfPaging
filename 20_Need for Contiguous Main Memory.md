# Page Table Problem 2 - Need for Contiguous Main Memory  ðŸ“˜ Concepts
- **Problem Identification:**
  - The second problem with page tables emphasizes the need for contiguous main memory.
  - Page tables, like physical pages of a process, should not be fragmented and necessitate a contiguous region in the main memory.
  - For instance, if a page table is four megabytes in size, it requires four megabytes of contiguous region in the main memory.
  - With a rise in the size of virtual address support, the page table size can drastically increase, as was discussed in problem number one.

- **Visualization and Example:**
  - Consider three processes P1, P2, and P3, each requiring three frames in the main memory for their page tables, illustrated using different colors for better comprehension.
  - Page tables of processes might be loaded in any three consecutive frames of main memory, underlining the need for contiguous frames.
  - A snapshot of the main memory shows the varying locations of the processes' page tables, highlighting their particular frames.

- **Challenges:**
  - With the enlargement of page tables, finding available consecutive frames becomes increasingly rare and challenging.
  - The likelihood of discovering contiguous frames in the main memory diminishes, making it difficult to accommodate entire page tables.

- **Solution: Multi-Level Paging:**
  - One solution to these problems is the introduction of multi-level paging, which essentially involves breaking large page tables into smaller sizes and loading them in non-contiguous frames in main memory.
  - Multi-level paging could be viewed as performing paging on page tables, thus addressing the issues arising from requiring contiguous memory spaces for larger page tables.

## ðŸ§  Curiosity
- **Question 1:** What is the significance of having contiguous main memory for page tables?
  - **Answer:** Contiguous main memory ensures that page tables are stored in sequential memory locations, preventing fragmentation and ensuring efficient and rapid access during address translation processes.

- **Question 2:** What challenges are posed by larger page tables in the context of managing contiguous memory?
  - **Answer:** Larger page tables exacerbate the difficulty of finding available, contiguous memory frames to accommodate them, especially in systems where memory allocation is dynamic and can be fragmented.

- **Question 3:** How does multi-level paging resolve the issue of needing contiguous memory frames for page tables?
  - **Answer:** Multi-level paging divides larger page tables into smaller pieces, enabling them to be loaded into non-contiguous frames in the main memory. This approach allows for easier management and allocation of memory without the stringent need for contiguous spaces.

- **Question 4:** How is multi-level paging distinct from traditional paging in terms of addressing the problem of page table storage in main memory?
  - **Answer:** Unlike traditional paging, multi-level paging subdivides the page table itself, applying another layer of paging to it. This allows the smaller sub-tables to be stored in non-contiguous memory spaces, mitigating the challenges posed by having to find larger contiguous memory blocks.

- **Question 5:** How could the increasing size of virtual address support impact the page table size, and what implications does this have for memory management?
  - **Answer:** An increasing size of virtual address support directly influences the size of the page table by making it larger and thus more cumbersome to manage in memory. This elevates the challenges of finding sufficient and contiguous memory frames for storage, impacting overall memory management and possibly system performance.

## ðŸŽ¯ Concepts in Simple Words
- Imagine page tables as lists that help a computer remember where it put certain data in its memory.
- Sometimes, these lists (page tables) get really big and need a lot of space in the computerâ€™s memory.
- The second problem weâ€™re talking about is that these big lists need to be put in a straight, unbroken line (contiguous) in the memory, which can be tricky because finding a big enough space gets harder as the lists get bigger.
- Think of it like trying to find a big enough shelf to store a really long board game box. If the box gets even longer (the list gets bigger), finding a suitable shelf gets even tougher.
- A cool solution to this is something called multi-level paging, where we break the big box (the list/page table) into smaller boxes that can be placed on different, smaller shelves (non-contiguous memory) instead of needing one big one! So, even if the shelves are not next to each other, we can still store all the small boxes easily.
